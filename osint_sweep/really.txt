The fastest growing and #1 rated wireless carrier in the USA
Thousands have switched in the fight to protect privacy and keep our
families safe.
Stellar network performance with a privacy-first approach
I have a background in cybersecurity and l'm a huge privacy advocate. I
believe that large mobile carriers have been poor stewards of their
customers sensitive personal information. Really's limited information
retention and sharing is a huge factor. If Really were to have a
breach, I know my sensitive information would not be leaked because
they do not retain certain information.
Matthew Fraley
Verified
Great Experience
Really is going to be a huge gamechanger in the cellphone market. The
customer service and actual service are wonderful. I can't sing their
praises enough. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!

Seamless Process - Excellent Connection
The process was seamless. System is well automated and walks you
through the entire process. eSIM setup was painless unlike many other
big cellular companies. Speeds so far have been faster than T-mobile in
VA and MD....

Really Wireless feels like the future...
Activating my eSIM took just minutes, and I was impressed by how easy
it was to get started. What really sets Really Wireless apart is the
suite of privacy tools included - from a built-in VPN to encrypted
calling - things the big carriers don't even talk about. It's clear
this company is built for people who care about their digital freedom.

Trust me, it’s worth it!
Like everyone, I thought it was a scam because of the advertisements.
Little did I know my trial old turned into adding all my devices and
cutting my phone bill in half!! thanks REALLY

REALLY Wireless The Best Carrier, Customer Service & Most Secure
My bill is much cheaper and they do not store and information at all
anywhere and all messages and phone calls are encrypted. I also needed
to contact customer service and they went above and beyond in every way
and quickly as well. What more could you ask for. It does not get any
better than REALLY DeWi Wireless. Switch today I promise you you won't
regret it.

Not too good to be true
I saw the ads on instagram and thought it’s too good to be true but
it’s true. I have service in places I haven’t before - inside my work
building not so much, but it’s a big concrete building so what do you
expect. But the process was easy too.

Great coverage. Great customer service
During cross country trips including remote areas, Really's coverage
through T-Mobile has proven to be far superior to Verizon's. I just
ported over my lines. Bye-bye Verizon. I had some issues during the
porting process on Verizon's side and Really s side. Really's customer
support team was extremely helpful to get those resolved quickly.

Verified
A new kind of phone company
Really is the new kid on the block, they are doing something unique and
new, which comes with benefits and the satisfaction of not going with
the big companies. The customer support is much more personal.
