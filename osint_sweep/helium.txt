Helium isn’t just a network—it’s a movement. Each Hotspot is a beacon
of change, challenging an industry built on high prices and poor
coverage. Powered by people, not corporations, it expands access,
proving that connectivity can be fairer, stronger, and truly belong to
everyone.

Powered by HNT.
Powered by HNT.
Helium flips the traditional wireless infrastructure model and puts you
in charge.
The economic backbone of this model is HNT, a cryptocurrency, which
provides incentive for growth. HNT must be burned (removed from supply)
to purchase Data Credits in order for devices to use the Networks.
