DeNet: Powering the Future of Decentralized Storage
By leveraging idle computing power from users worldwide, DeNet
creates a distributed cloud ecosystem that challenges traditional
centralized providers like AWS and Google Cloud.
DeNet is building a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud
services, making storage and computing cheaper, safer, and more
private. Instead of relying on big corporations, DeNet uses a network
of independent users who contribute their spare computing power in
exchange for rewards.
Its system runs on two types of nodes: Datakeepers, who provide storage
and computing power, and Watcher nodes, who verify data integrity and
keep the network secure. This setup ensures fast, reliable, and
censorship-resistant cloud services, perfect for the Web3 era.
🚨 For signing up to DeNet and running your own Watcher Node on your
phone (for free), you can use my code and get 1000 $WN as a starting
boost: 👇🏼
0x85b606054ea9ef37166527fe6a17075af1cf53d0
(Or use the DeNet app download link at the end of this post with the
code already applied.)
Plus, you can now make a reservation for the new Datakeeper Nodes,
which stores real-world data and offers real big rewards! Reservation
costs $100 and is refundable should you decide not to buy the node.
This reservation phase ends on the 20th of March 2025 but locking in
your spot asap guarantees the cheapest node price. The first price
stage for $529 is already gone. As of now, there are only 473
reservation spots left for $609/node. After that the price increases to
$689/node! So make sure to be quick. 😉
Depending on how much harddisk space you are willing to allocate to
your Datakeeper Node, you can earn anywhere from $50 (6TB) to $1500
(180TB) per month(!) as passive income. Of course, you can even boost
your monthly earnings more by having even more storage space at hand!
Check the earnings potential calculator on the following link.
🚨 Here you'll find all the info about the node sale and the Datakeeper
Node: https://nodesale.denet.app/
Using my referral code also grants you an additional 5% off the final
Datakeeper Node price!!

All of the above projects have social media and their updates are

- For browser extension projects, you can use either Chrome, Brave,
Herond or any desktop browser of your choice based in your OS
- You can also farm using mobile browsers like KIWI and MISES with the
required extensions
- Mobile apps and telegrams are pretty much easy to farm
Try those projects and give a feeback! If you face any issues then ask

resource!)

7% is reserved for airdrop (100% unlocked at TGE) cost = $0
Funding: $9M

Linux, VPS)
1. Create an account with the above referral
2. Download the Node rClinet : https://rivalz.ai/download
3. Click on connect wallet & select Metamask(Use burner wallet. Use
the correct wallet. You can't change the wallet in rClient))

around $550 but with my referral link it will give you 10% discount and
it will cost you only $495. I have already bought one as there is a
huge potential with Rivalz with big airdrop. (Do you own research
before you buy this and not a financial advice!)
