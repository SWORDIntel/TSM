XNET: Making a Difference in Mobile
Problem:
Legacy telecom networks are straining under growing data demand.
Building 5G infrastructure is costly and slow, leading to higher prices
and coverage gaps in rural and urban areas. Major mobile carriers (MNOs
& MVNOs) cannot keep up the pace, leaving their customers unsatisfied
and underserved.
Solution:
XNET’s network delivers seamless Hotspot 2.0 WiFi offload that
transforms modern connectivity. Our network bypasses the limits of
traditional systems by providing scalable, high-capacity data
transmission where legacy networks fail. This approach ensures fast,
secure, and cost-effective connectivity for carriers and their
customers.
Ecosystem:
Partnered with the largest U.S. mobile carrier, XNET is aggressively
expanding its network by onboarding additional MNOs and MVNOs
domestically and internationally. Carriers offload data demand via our
Access Points, while deployers earn passive income and are rewarded for
building the XNET network.
Innovation:
XNET leverages Solana to decentralize its network and reward
contributors. This method eliminates single points of failure and
delivers reliable connectivity at a lower cost than traditional
solutions. By merging blockchain with enterprise-grade WiFi hardware,
XNET drives cellular networks to operate at peak efficiency, delivering
the connectivity everyone deserves.
